## Review ##

For the final project of my course at Makers Academy, we wanted to build something fun and lightweight which could benefit a wide range of users. We also wanted to practice a new technology so decided to build it in React. We were successful in working as a team with regular check-ins, stand-ups and retro's and I also ran morning walkthroughs of some of the new code. Personally I learn't a lot about working in a team as well as improving my skills in React and with websockets.
